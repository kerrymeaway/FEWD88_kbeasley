<h1>The Capital Sales Process</h1>


<h2>Checklist for Gotham Sports Reps</h2>
<ul>
<li>As soon / often as you can, find out when current capital equipment contracts are up. Ask when current equipment was purchased.</li>
<li>Always know how future capital equipment contract decisions will be made, what aspects will be important and who makes the decisions along each step of the process in each of your accounts</li>
</ul>


<p>The capital equipment sale is very different than the sale of the Swivelock. Reps are more successful when make it their business to know who the decision makers are at every account, what equipment is currently being used, when those contracts end, how surgeons and facilities move and store images, etc.</p>

<p>Check back for more information and tips.</p>
