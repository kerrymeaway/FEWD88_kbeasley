Product Notes Synergy – 4K Technology

Question: Is the Arthrex SynergyUHD4 system a true 4K camera system?

Answer: The native pixel count of the camera heads is 3840 x 2160. This pixel information is transmitted to the SynergyUHD4 console and then transmitted to the Arthrex 4K monitor via Display Port cables at the 3840 x 2160 pixel count. There is no upscaling and the system is a true 4K camera system. For documentation purposes, we capture 4K stills, but also have the ability to create a separate 1080p stream within our video processor for capturing videos or smaller size stills.

Question: But I thought that true 4K was 4096 x 2160 and that 3840 x 2160 was considered UHD?

Answer: 4K has become synonymous with UHD in all industries with the exception of cinema, and is defined by these industries 3840 x 2160 with 16:9 aspect ratio. The 4096 x 2160 is what is used in cinema, with the difference being the aspect ratio of 17:9 (this accounts for the increased horizontal pixel count.

In simple terms, 4K content offers twice the number of pixels offered by the current HD standard 1080p (1,920 x 1,080).
