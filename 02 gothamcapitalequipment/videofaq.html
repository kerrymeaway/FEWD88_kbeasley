<h1>Synergy Video – FAQ</h1>

<ul class="faq">
<li><strong>Question: How do I check which software version my Synergy has?</strong>
Answer: 
On Samsung tablet, at login screen, tap twice anywhere in blue space around the words. A black window should appear. Tap 'About.' In the next window, you should see software version at the top. If a patch has been applied, look for this also. There are older Synergy CCUs in the Gotham territory that cannot be updated past 1. version software.</li>

<li><strong>Question: What video cables does Synergy UHD4K/ HD3 use?</strong>
Answer: UHD4k =  DP cables; HD3 = DVI or HDSDI cables. If you're purchasing a cable for a secondary monitor, HDSDI = best for distances over 25ft; DVI is not adequate for carrying video signal over distances longer than 15-16ft. </li>
</ul>
