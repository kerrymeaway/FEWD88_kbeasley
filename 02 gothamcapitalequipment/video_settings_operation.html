Operation – Synergy UHD4K

Begin a Case

Turn power on tower or console
All interaction with the Synergy video system happens through the Samsung tablet. This is simply a tablet made by Samsung with apps that run. It functions like any other tablet.
When tablet starts up, the Arthrex app that controls everything will launch. A blue login screen will appear when it’s ready.
When changing any permanent settings, be sure to login as Admin. (Password is always synergy or synergyhd3)
To start a case,  click the blue button in top corner: “Add a Case”
Choose surgeon’s name from dropdown menu (if you don’t see your surgeon, you must login as Admin and add him to the list in Surgeon Preferences)
Choose type of case from dropdown menu (if you don’t see your case, you must login as Admin and add it in Surgeon Preferences to the list of procedures that your surgeon performs)
Enter patient information
Click Start
Plug in camera head and light cable (light cable must be turned on from the console)
White balance: the first time either camera head button is pushed will always be a white balance. If a button is pushed inadvertently, a white balance can only be done by pushing the button on the front of the console. You will know that this happened because the camera head buttons revert to surgeon preference settings after white balance happens and usually the left quick press will start taking still images. At this point, please remind the surgeon to white balance before going any further.
End a Case

There are two ways to end a case. Case images and video are saved on the drive inside CCU. If you login as Admin you can adjust how many cases can be saved in Advanced Options /Settings. The max is 200 cases is the maximum and older cases will be deleted if CCU is not backed up. This is a good reason to have the conversation about Surgeon Vault Cloud Storage for your surgeons

Camera Settings

Question: What does Gain mean?
Answer: Gain – increases the brightness – deals with compensating for brightness.

Case too dark?

Putting the light output on “high” is not recommended – only an option if there is not enough light – the indication of not enough light is turning the brightness up does not impact picture brightness (increasing gain would be your first option, then light output).

 

Question: What does the heart icon on the front of 4k CCU mean?
Answer: Means Synergy is Defibrillator-Proof

Some medical equipment within the hospital is classified as defibrillator proof. When a defibrillator is discharged through a patient connected to defibrillator proof equipment, the equipment will not be damaged by the defibrillator’s energy. Defibrillator proof equipment can remain connected to the patient during defibrillation. It is identified by one of the following symbols.
