Dualwave Pump – Offers both inflow and outflow

Knee – 50
Shoulder – 35
Hip – 30?
Small Joint – 30?
Continuous Wave Pump – Offers inflow only
Knee – 30
Shoulder – 40
* Run pump at lowest pressure possible to enable surgeon to view joint space. The higher the pressure, the greater the risk of blowing up the joint, which increases postoperative swelling and pain for the patient. The goal of the Dualwave Pump is to keep pressure from fluctuating erratically. The Dualwave controls the flow rate based on what pressure you choose. It’s designed to “set and forget.”

How can I adjust the flow on the DualWave?

The Dualwave Pump doesn’t have a flow adjustment; flow is automatic when you adjust the pressure setting. The pump works to maintain a set pressure at all times. Flow into the joint increases and decreases based on how much fluid is exiting the joint space. Increase incoming fluid by removing fluid.

DualWave Feature: Shaver Detect

The Shaver Detect feature is best when the Arthrex Shaver is used with the Arthrex Dualwave Pump. Varying success has been had using competitive shavers, the least of which is the Linvatec shaver.

DualWave Tip: Conserve Fluid

When using gravity or single-patient use tubing, spike only the bags you will use. Also, use the lowest volume bag you might require for the surgery to reduce waste.
Consider using multi-patient-use pump tubing – this is available from a variety of pump manufacturers. Also available is extension tubing with a backflow valve to allow the reuse of tubing with gravity inflow.
Consider using pumps that have inflow and outflow fluid management systems, as opposed to inflow management only. This can reduce fluid usage by as much as 35%.
Consider placing cannulas if there is excessive portal leakage to reduce fluid usage.
If you must use smaller bags (such as 1000 ml IV bags), additional “Y” tubing is available so up to 4 bags of fluid may be spiked at a time. But again, spike only as many as you think you will use!
What is your goal?

Our pump’s top goal is to keep pressure from fluctuating all over the place.
The pump controls flow rate based on set pressure. It’s designed to “set and forget.”
Rinse  – fast way to control the outflow

Suggested Pressure Settings by Joint

Knee: 50 to start

In the knee joint, the DualWave is different than other pumps (in what way?)
Pumps is designed to monitor what fluid is entering AND exiting the joint- it will adjust inflow to keep distention (how will it know what’s leaving the joint if there’s no outflow tubing being used?
Control flow using the outflow cannula
Distention – parts the inside of the capsule – makes sure they aren’t collapsed on themselves enough to allow surgeon to see what she’s doing
Shoulder: 35 start place

In the shoulder, the risk of damage is greater. Distention is achieved by running at a lower pressure because you run the risk of blowing it up
Hemostasis no postoperative swelling, the more (added)

Product-  Pump
How do I increase outflow? Press Rinse (Rinse only works when using outflow tubing)
DW Pump: does not have a flow adjustment; flow is automatic, we get fluid in by taking fluid out. flow into the joint goes increases and decreases based on how much is coming out
Pump – top goal is to maintain the same pressure in joint
Knee: Start at 50
Shoulder: Start at 35
(added)
Medium auctions good for shoulder not tons of blood
High is better for knee
