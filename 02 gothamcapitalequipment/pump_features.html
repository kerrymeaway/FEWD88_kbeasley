Feature: Using Alternative Suction Pathway (ASP) Mode

(ASP Mode must be activated in Default Settings before case has begun)

The AR-6480 pump has an ASP function for minimizing blade clogging issues. The ASP MODE is only accessible in INFLOW/OUTFLOW MODE. In ASP Mode changes the suction pathway from the shaver suction pathway to the cannula suction pathway at the shaver suction level.

Turn on ASP MODE in OUTFLOW SHAVER default menu.
Press the RINSE button on the Remote control or Foot Pedal while the shaver is activated to enable this function. The Shaver button will turn Red. The suction pathway will change from the shaver suction pathway to the cannula suction pathway.
The ASP mode will stop when the shaver is deactivated or by exiting ASP mode when the user presses the RINSE button a second time on the Remote Control or Foot Pedal while the shaver is activated.
Feature: Shaver Detect

Users can adjust the Shaver Detect function for optimal interfacing performance. To change the settings press these buttons in this sequence: MENU > DEFAULTS > SHAVER. The screen displays and allows changes to the settings for Shaver Suction and Shaver Detect.
There are four Shaver Detect Presets that offer various levels of sensitivity. The user may select from the four presets preloaded into the DualWave or adjust each preset according to individual need. This can be done by pressing the EDIT button after a preset has been selected.

There are three settings inside each preset that are changeable by the user:

THRESHOLD is the level of sensitivity that the DualWave uses to detects the incoming signal from the Shaver Console. This ranges from 1 to 100.
DELAY controls the amount of time the Shaver Detect Circuit examines the incoming signal from the Shaver Console before it activates the pinch roller mechanism. This ranges from 0 – 10 (1/10ths of a second).
DRIFT TRACKER controls whether or not the DualWave will constantly adjust the stored shaver current baseline reading. This can be turned on or off.
Once the necessary adjustments have been made, press the DONE button to save the changes to the selected preset.

Note to User:

Select the highest THRESHOLD that will allow detection of the shaver when used at typical RPMs.
Increase the DELAY setting to filter out noisy electrical conditions/ interference from other electrical fields
All four presets can be reset by pressing the RESET DEFAULTS button on the MENU screen.
The Shave Console must be completely powered up before powering on the pump.
A new baseline is captured when pressing the RUN button. The screen will display a message reading, “ACQUIRING SHAVER BASELINE.” During the baseline capture, do not activate a shaver.
Cautions to User:

As the THRESHOLD value decreases, so does the DualWave’s ability to prevent false detections of shaver activation. This condition makes the DualWave behave like the shaver handpiece is activated when it is not. This is characterized by sporadic movement of the pinch roller between the Shaver and Cannula tube ends. Conversely, as the THRESHOLD value increases, so does the likelihood of the DualWave not recognizing shaver activation. This can result in failure of the DualWave to provide for aspiration through the shaver blade and result in retention of heat within the blade.
As the DELAY values decreases the DualWave will have less time to analyze the information received through the shaver detect circuit. This action can result in a false detection. Increasing the DELAY value should alleviate this condition. As the DELAY value increases, the accuracy of the determination of the shaver handpiece state will improve, but at the highest levels, the DELAY time may result in a perceived lag before the DualWave responds to the shaver activation.The shaver detect function of the DualWave has been verified to function properly with the Arthrex Adapteur II shaver console. It is the responsibility of the user facility to evaluate 3rd party shaver consoles to determine the correct operating parameters and any potential hazards of utilizing the DualWave with an alternate shaver console.
