If the following messages are seen on pump screen, see list below to troubleshoot

 

*Lack of distention/ Liquid is Bloody / Cloudy
1. Activate LAVAGE mode
2. Increase pressure
3. Decrease outflow

*Tubing Out 
1. Tubing sensor indicator not seated
2. Ensure that the tubing pressure plug is plugged in completely
3. No luck? Change tubeset
* Return to Arthrex for repair

*Console Fails Self Diagnostic Test
1. Ensure no tubing is connected to the pump during power on sequence
* Return to Arthrex for repair

*Console will not power up
1. Check main power cord connectivity
2. Try alternate power outlet
* Return to Arthrex for repair

*Does not pump when activated
1. Check for error messages
2. Release all tubing clamps and shut-off valves
3. Ensure actual pressure is below target pressure
4. Check if the tubing is pinched, kinked, or blocked …. or being stepped on.
* Return to Arthrex for repair

*Door Open
1. Roller housing not secured – ensure locking lever is properly secured
* Return to Arthrex for repair

*Inadequate Pressure
1. Increase pressure
2. Activate LAVAGE mode
3. Reduce outflow
4. Use high-flow cannulas

*No / Low Flow
1. Check for error messages
2. Check that all tubing clamps are open
3. Check the settings for flow and pressure
4. Check if the tubing is pinched, kinked or blocked
5. Check that tubing seats correctly over the rollers (positioned in the center of black rollers, not being pinched by door when closed)
6. Verify use of high-flow cannulas
7. If failure remains, return to Arthrex for repair

*Overpressure 
1. Increase or open outflow
2. Manipulate joint to stress-free position

*Pressure Fault
1. Ensure adequate fluid supply
2. Decrease outflow
3. Check tubing for damage and if it is pinched, kinked or blocked
4. Check tubing for proper connections
5. Replace tubing with a fresh tubeset
6. If failure remains, return to Arthrex for repair

*No Shaver Detection
1. Ensure universal shaver cable is connected properly
2. Turn on and off DualWave while the shaver system is powered on
3. Change SHAVER DETECTION PRESET to alternate setting
4. Isolate the power source (plug into a source that is completely apart from any other – removing any possible issues with electrical field interference)
5. If failure remains, return to Arthrex for repair
