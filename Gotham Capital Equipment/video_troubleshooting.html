The first method to solve any problem; restart console. The Synergy console is a computer. Computer problems can often be solved by a restart. No case data will be lost if this is done mid-case. Synergy will immediately search for “active case” when powered back up.

Also, please double/ triple check that you are connected to power…..

Tablet Issues

Problem: Tablet is unable to connect to Synergy,  “Network Connection Lost” Screen, or “Frozen Tablet” Screen
Answer(s): Download a new app to Samsung tablet. It’s possible the app got “wonky” and won’t work correctly. Replacing it with a new copy from the app store sometimes helps.

Enable wifi on Samsung tablet
Close out of app internet browser app on tablet desktop
Find browser app on tablet desktop
Open Internet browser on tablet
Type in URL field: 10.43.47.101/controller.apk
In the right-hand corner, you should see an arrow point to a horizontal line (download happening) . Click that symbol for recently downloaded apps
When Tablet asks whether you want to replace current app, click ‘yes’
Clear cache and force stop if this doesn’t work
Or check USB connection:

Unplug the tablet from the console and reinsert
Restart the tablet itself
Try plugging it into another USB port in back of Synergy
Make sure tablet is firmly seated in charger cradle
Sometimes the tablet will take a few minutes find the console (CCU). Once the USB cable is reinserted into the tablet, look for the battery charge icon. If still locked after a minute or so, a restart button will appear. Click this. Reconnection should occur.
Problem: Network connection never happens – tablet screen is blue/ login screen never appears
Answer: Download a new app onto the Samsung Tablet

Enable wifi on Samsung tablet
Open Internet browser on tablet
Type in URL field: 10.43.47.101/controller.apk
Click download symbol in lower right corner for recently downloaded apps
When Tablet asks whether you want to replace current app, click ‘yes.’  No case data will be lost because case are stored in the console. The tablet app is simply to allow us to communicate with the console
Open new app and network connection should happen faster

Problem: Frozen screen
Answer:  See below:

Kiosk Advanced Settings

Device options ->
1-1-1-1 ->
OK
Lastly, double check all physical connections, i.e. cables.
Problem: Samsung tablet has the message “Kernel Panic upload mode”
Answer: Hold down power until it turns off then reboot. This is caused by powering on and accidentally holding down one of the volume buttons (next to power button)
Problem: I’m unable to change the facility name in advanced settings
Answer: Unpair Synergy with Synergy.net demo laptop
Problem: How do I remove the black bars on top and bottom of the Samsung tablet?

Problem: Tablet screen shows battery symbol when powered up
Answer: Tablet was most likely left running overnight. (Stress the importance of this to staff: Always power down tablet after turning off cart itself; it is powered by battery and will run itself out, leaving you without connection when you need it)
Plug in tower and let it charge. It will start when ready for a case, usually after 10-15 minutes.

 

Monitor Issues

 

Problem: Entire image on monitor is flipped. Color bars are on outside and black bars are in center (opposite of normal)
Answer: If the DP cables are reversed.

Unplug the DP cables and switch them to opposite outlets.
Turn monitor on and off again after plugging cables into correct outlets. If this doesn’t fix the problem you may have a bad DP cable.
Check the monitor’s black level within the monitor settings.
Problem: Monitor getting endless color bars when tower is powered on / not getting usual black curtains on either side of screen
Answer:  Previous case wasn’t ended properly. Plug and unplug camera head. Previous case will end automatically. You should see a 30-second countdown on monitor screen.

 

Export Issues

Problem: Small yellow triangles with exclamation points next to certain cases when a surgeon tries to export his cases
Answer: Auto export was set for iPad and iPad wasn’t plugged in. Turn off Auto Export to … iPad, USB, PDF, etc.
Problem: Export taking too long
Answer: Chapter Video setting is disabled. If you have a surgeon that records the entire procedure, it helps to enable Chapter Video in Advanced Settings. This saves a separate video file every 5 mins, rather than a continuous long video clip. This will result in many small video files instead of one long video file. Smaller files download faster.
Problem: During Network Export, folders are titled with numbers instead of patient / surgeon names in Tablet, adjust PIE to ON (login as Admin, in settings)
Answer: Login as Admin Tablet > Advanced Settings > Adjust PIE to ON (login as Admin, in settings)
Problem: Case happens, but does not show up in archived list. Images from a case are not saving. After case, images are gone.
Answer:  It’s possible to complete an entire case without starting it on tablet. Make sure to start the case on tablet or Synergy doesn’t know there’s a case happening or that there are images being captured.
Problem: I can’t see pump / shaver information on screen (This feature is called Heads-Up Display) – After 3.7.4 Update
Answer: (picture)

Login to tablet as Admin (password: synergy)
In Advanced Settings, enable both Pump Display and Shaver Display by scrolling to bottom of page
In Procedure Management, for each procedure, set to ON position
In Surgeon Management, for each procedure listed under surgeon’s name, set Pump Shaver Display to ON position
Check cable connections: cable with plastic insert goes into Synergy. Metal ended ones are daisy chained into RS232 outlet in both machines –> Synergy into Pump, Pump into Shaver
 

Scope & Camera Issues

Problem: Scope Image goes (very) yellow after a white balance
Answer: Bad white balance.
Regardless of how the camerahead buttons are set, the first push of any button will always be a white balance. Sometimes, when tech is expecting to be able to control light source from camerahead, he or she will start pressing buttons before a white balance can be done. Avoid this confusion by telling nurse to ALWAYS turn on light source from console when plugging in light source. After that, white balance happens when first button is pushed as it should.
Problem: Fogging Camera Head
Answer: Causes for fogging:

Make sure the account is doing the proper cycle during sterilization and most importantly letting it dry for the correct amount of time.
Make sure they are not opening warm or wet equipment. Finally, if the C-mount scope is missing, has a cracked, or broken black o-ring then this can also cause fogging.
If scope and camera head have not been attached immediately and sit apart until case begins, this could mean that moisture has been introduced to the field and transferred to scope. UponInstruct Scrub Tech to assemble beforehand, the problem did not recur.
**** Just to recap about this question. The results were that some of the group have seen fogging when the user does not tighten the scope all the way down on the camera head. This is typically solved with explanation about making sure it is tight. We started a project for a temporary solution by using a wrench to get it tight. Arthrex looking at a longer timeline solution of redesigning the C-Mount scope to have a more ergonomic nut to help the user tighten it properly (and remove it.)
Problem: “Double Vision” Seeing two scopes on screen (Jeff Caravello Bellevue)
Answer: The coupler for the C-Mount camera not screwed in tight enough.
Problem: Image shifts on screen (Tim McIntyre WCOASC)
Answer: Scope is not seated firmly in camera head. Re-insert and gently tighten seal by spreading black “bunny ears” on camera head apart.
Problem: Image on screen appears yellow and green, prints come out this way too (Scott Scherick RUMC)
Answer: check camera head and try re- white balance. Change camera head. White balance again
Problem: Very warm camera head in surgeon’s hand (RUMC, ALL CITY)
Answer: Our UHD4 camera heads are warmer than the HD3 due to size and increased light output of UHD 4K. Also, C-mount camera heads have potential to get warmer than the eye cup camera head. There is 4 times the amount of processing going on inside the camera head. The camera head will not get warmer than 111 degrees. It will top out at that.
Problem: Camerahead not taking photos, camerahead doesn’t beep when button is pressed.
Answer(s):How are the buttons programmed? (check this by clicking settings dial on left side of tablet during active case (insert pic), on left side, click button icon, choose from drop down menu of options for each button) If buttons are not programmed as expected, this is where they can be changed for case duration. Permanent changes can be made in Surgeon Management.

Does camerahead beep when button is pushed?  Is camerahead paddle fully inserted in console? Try re-inserting it. Check gold stripes on paddle for smudges /dirt that could get in way of signal.

Is it possible to restart the console?  (this can be done mid-case without losing anything; Synergy will immediately search for “active case” when powered back up)
Problem: Scope on screen is “jumpy”
Answer: This means the scope isn’t tight in the camerahead and needs to be tightened by pushing two black bumps on camera head apart, right? He’s using a bit more force to get into a tight space.

 

Troubleshooting the Synergy Surgeon App

Problem: Surgeon wants to record a personal message to the patient to be included with the emailed patient report.
Answer: Once the video is recorded, surgeon can save to content section of Surgeon Vault and attach to template(s) when creating a patient report on iPad. Patient email address should be entered when Send is clicked.  DOB to automatically transfer to iPad and then Surgeon Vault.
Problem: Surgeon cannot download case from Cloud storage
Answer: Download can only happen one time (?)
Problem: Exported cases going to Unassigned category
Answer: Configure your surgeons so that the email on the CCU matches the users email address on the iPad. To recover exported cases on the iPad that are in Unassigned Case limbo, click on user’s name in top right corner of app. When dropdown menu appears, click Unassigned. When list of unassigned cases shows up, click blue symbol to the right of case and case will be available on iPad case list.
