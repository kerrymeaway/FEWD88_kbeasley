SHAVER TROUBLESHOOTING

Problem: Screen Message =  FS Pedal Stuck, Remove and Repower
Answer: The console is trying to communicate with the foot pedal. If a pedal/button is pressed or stuck in an active state, the console will display that message. It’s basically, telling you to start over. Unplug the FS and repower the console to reset everything and then try the same foot pedal again. If the message continues to be displayed, then there is an issue with the pedal and it should come back to Arthrex for repair.

 

Problem: Footswitch stays in active state
Answer: It’s most likely a mechanical thing and will require removing the pad and the membrane, which will destroy it.

 

Problem: Debris is clogging the shaver
Answer: Use Alternate Suction Pathway (ASP) Mode. Debris flows out of joint from another portal, away from blade while it’s being used. (see below)

 

Alternate Suction Pathway (ASP) Mode

(Must be set in defaults before case)
The Dualwave pump has an ASP function for minimizing clogging issues. Generally it’s used when debris is clogging the shaver and you would like debris to flow out of the joint, but be sucked from another portal / away from blade while it’s being used. The ASP MODE is only accessible in INFLOW/OUTFLOW MODE. In ASP Mode, the suction pathway is changed from the shaver suction to cannula (blue outflow tube) suction, diverting debris away from blade.

Turn ON ASP MODE in OUTFLOW SHAVER default menu.
Press the RINSE button on the Remote control or Foot Pedal [iv] while the shaver is activated to enable this function. The Shaver button will turn Red. The suction pathway will change from the shaver suction pathway to the cannula suction pathway.
The ASP mode will stop when the shaver is deactivated or by exiting ASP mode when the user presses the RINSE button a second time on the Remote Control or Foot Pedal [IV] while the shaver is activated.
Recommended Shaver Settings

All blades: 1750 Oscillate Aggressive
Doublecut = 2300 – 2500 Oscillate Aggressive
FWD & REV = 6200 – 6800
* shaver will go to 3000rpm in OSC mode, although it will be uncomfortable to use beyond 2400 

Using Shaver Detect with Dualwave Pump

Users can adjust the Shaver Detect function for optimal performance of both. To change the settings, on the shaver screen, press: MENU > DEFAULTS > SHAVER. The screen displays and allows changes to the settings for Shaver Suction and Shaver Detect.
There are four Shaver Detect Presets that offer various levels of sensitivity. The user may select from the four presets preloaded into the DualWave or adjust each preset according to individual need. This can be done by pressing the EDIT button after a preset has been selected.
There are three settings inside each preset that are changeable by the user:

THRESHOLD is the level of sensitivity that the DualWave uses to detects the incoming signal from the Shaver Console. This ranges from 1 to 100.
DELAY controls the amount of time the Shaver Detect Circuit examines the incoming signal from the Shaver Console before it activates the pinch roller mechanism. This ranges from 0 – 10 (1/10ths of a second).
DRIFT TRACKER controls whether or not the DualWave will constantly adjust the stored shaver current baseline reading. This can be turned on or off.
Once the necessary adjustments have been made, press the DONE button to save the changes to the selected preset.

Select the highest THRESHOLD that will allow detection of the shaver when used at typical RPMs.
Increase the DELAY setting to filter out noisy electrical conditions/ interference from other electrical fields.
All four presets can be reset by pressing the RESET DEFAULTS button on the MENU screen.
The Shave Console must be completely powered up before powering on the pump.
A new baseline is captured when pressing the RUN button on the pump. The screen will display a message reading, “ACQUIRING SHAVER BASELINE.” During the baseline capture, do not activate the shaver.
Cautions to User:

As the THRESHOLD value decreases, so does the DualWave’s ability to prevent false detections of shaver activation. This condition makes the DualWave behave like the shaver handpiece is activated when it is not. This is characterized by sporadic movement of the pinch roller between the Shaver and Cannula tube ends. Conversely, as the THRESHOLD value increases, so does the likelihood of the DualWave not recognizing shaver activation. This can result in failure of the DualWave to provide for aspiration through the shaver blade and result in retention of heat within the blade.
As the DELAY values decreases the DualWave will have less time to analyze the information received through the shaver detect circuit. This action can result in a false detection. Increasing the DELAY value should alleviate this condition. As the DELAY value increases, the accuracy of the determination of the shaver handpiece state will improve, but at the highest levels, the DELAY time may result in a perceived lag before the DualWave responds to the shaver activation.
The shaver detect function of the DualWave has been verified to function properly with the Arthrex Adapteur II shaver console. It is the responsibility of the user facility to evaluate 3rd party shaver consoles to determine the correct operating parameters and any potential hazards of utilizing the DualWave with an alternate shaver console.

Adjusting Shaver Speed from Handset/ Handpiece

Note: The handpiece has to be running for this to work.

While running, press and hold the Direction button (top button, closest to blade) for 2 seconds. Console will beep, letting you know you’re in speed change mode.
While in speed change mode, pressing the direction button will increase speed, pressing the on/off button will decrease speed.
To exit, don’t press either button for 2 seconds. Console will beep letting you know you’ve exited speed change mode and handpiece resumes normal operation.
 

 

SHAVER MODES EXPLAINED

Standard mode, blade spins for a half a second in each direction which means that you can get several revolutions in that timeframe. Up to 6 to 10 times.
Efficient mode: blade spins two times in each direction, but there is significant braking into ramp up speed when there’s a direction change, which in turn makes it easy to control.
Aggressive mode: spins two times in each direction, but significantly less braking and ramp up than efficient mode
Or

Standard mode =  SNN
Efficient mode = Stryker
Aggressive mode = Linvatec
Or

STD Mode – Based on Time: goes for 0.3 seconds in each direction. Higher speed means more revolutions before changing directions.
**Most control; least aggressive.
EFF Mode – 2 revs before changing directions, regardless of speed setting. Has a smoother transition because of the braking and acceleration time.
**Excellent control and aggressiveness.
AGG Mode – Also, 2 revs before changing directions, regardless of speed setting. Hard transition between directions because of the short braking and acceleration times.
**Least control; most aggressive.
 

“I recommend setting up the console in the osc mode at EFF, 1750 rpm and FWD/REV at 6,200 rpm. That is where all the blades and burrs are optimized for peak performance. Let the doc ask for any changes.”
